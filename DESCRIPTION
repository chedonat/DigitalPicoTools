Description:
       This package offers a set of tools for Digital analysis of whole genome sequencing of Picogram quantities of DNA. It contains a set of functions to compute and manipulate Long Fragment Reads (LFR) extracted from a DigitalPico Sequencing experiment. It includes functions to retrieve and visualize variants allelic count and fraction from a DigitalPico experiment.  Functions to retrieve and manipulate phasing and linkage information of genomic elements are still under implementations and will be included in a future version.
