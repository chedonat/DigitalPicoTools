\title{Compute the Phaisng Code}
\usage{
ComputePhasingCode(LFR_withMutations_df, Mutations_set, mode = "recursive")
}
\description{
This function computes the phasing codes of each mutations. Mutations with the same phasing code are considered as phased (e.g PH_101_0 and PH_101_0) . Mutations with the same phasing fragment code but different allele index are considered as not phased(e.g PH_101_1 and PH_101_0) .
